 To Do List 

todolist.py - A simple and personalized to-do list manager

Author: Samuel Pinto

Description:
This script is my first step into Python programmingâ€”a tool to help organize tasks and get stuff done. It's designed to be a straightforward to-do list where I can add, view, and manage my tasks in a way that works for me.

Main Features:
- Add tasks to your list
- Mark tasks as complete
- View your list of tasks (both completed and pending)
- Option to remove tasks once they are done

The goal here isn't just functionality, but also learning how Python works through practical application. This is a work in progress, and I look forward to making it better as I learn more.

Let's keep getting things done!
